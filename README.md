# Hand Sign game
#### It's an image processing project in my third year at Computer department in Faculty of Engineering Cairo University.
## In this game:
* The player must make a number of special hand signs quickly.<br>
* The game will use the webcam to read the userâ€™s movements.<br>
* The screen will be split into four areas.<br>
* The player will be given a chain of hand signs to make as well as where to place their hand (in the four areas of the screen).<br>
* Player score will be stored. Every correct hand sign adds points and every wrong one subtracts points.<br>
